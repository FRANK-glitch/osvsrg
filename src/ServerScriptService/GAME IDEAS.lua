	SAVING
		--dunno
		--make it work probably, not important
		--nvm it's important
		--two datastores, player stats and map stats [done (not verbatum i think, but the general concept is similar)]
		--for map stats, each map will have 10 tables
		--each table correlates with the top play
		--for the stats, there are 3 tables, the first table is top score play for each map, the second table is top rating play for each map, 3rd one is options
		
	RATINGS
		--based on dans
		--start off with easy maps and 1st dan
		--unlock new maps by getting 97 on the dan
		--unlocks maps with diff up to before the next dan
			--eg beating 1st dan unlocks all maps rated to be before 2nd dan and 2nd dan
		--maps are rated based on where they would be in the dan spectrum
		--so if a map's diff would be between 10th and alpha it'd be 10.5
		--alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon would be 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15
