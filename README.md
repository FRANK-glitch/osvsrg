Replacement for RoBeats CS

# Mission and purpose

The game's purpose is to provide a fun and engaging environment for upcoming top players in the VSRG world.

This means no pay to win elements, forever. We want our players to get the most possible out of their RoBeats experience. Every aspect of the game is geared toward serious players. We want to give the most fair experience possible in a rhythm game.

# Current status

This is NOT the current version of RoBeats CS that is on Roblox right now. This is a pre-alpha rewrite of the game. Almost everything is getting an overhaul.

# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the codebase, just follow these steps and you'll be on your way!

1. Clone

Make sure you have git installed and run this:

`git clone https://github.com/RoVSRG/osvsrg.git --recurse-submodules`

This will clone the current codebase onto your computer.

2. Build

This is the most complicated step, but it is still incredibly easy to execute. All you have to do is `cd` into the working directory of the codebase with `cd robeats-cs`, make sure you have [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) installed (v6.0.0-rc.1), and run `mkdir build && rojo build --output build/osvsrg-build.rbxlx`. If everything went well, a new `.rbxlx` file should appear within the build directory. Use Rojo live-sync technology (`rojo serve` + Rojo live-sync plugin v6.0.0-rc.1) to sync the codebase with the local build of the game (the `.rbxlx` file) for easy-peasy testing. Now you are ready to code!

3. Contribute

Before doing anything, be sure to open an issue to discuss what you want to see in the game and whether the solution is feasable for the scope of this project. If we feel that the issue is good and would provide a contribution to the game, we will permit you to make the changes and open a pull request once you are done. Further discussion may occur after the PR (pull request) is made.

Thank you!

# More resources

The core focus of this game is to provide and excellent RoBeat-ing experience for all. However, after some months of playing we highly encourage you to check out [Etterna](https://etternaonline.com) or [osu!mania](http://osu.ppy.sh). While RoBeats CS allows for significant improvement, truly serious veterans of the game will see more improvement and possibility out of the options listed above than RoBeats CS woud likely ever provide.

# In Closing

Thank you all for playing RoBeats CS! If you know Lua (or any language) to any degree we encourage you to make an issue and discuss what YOU would like to see in-game! (We also don't mind if you don't know how to code, as long as the suggestion is practical :>)
